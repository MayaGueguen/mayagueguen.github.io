## [`FATE-HD` website](https://mayagueguen.github.io/FATE-WEBSITE/) <img src="pictures/link.png" alt="Link to" style="width:20px;height:20px;">

*"`FATE-HD` is a dynamic landscape vegetation model that simulates interactions between plant modelling entities (e.g. species or plant functional groups), their population dynamics and dispersal, whilst taking into account external drivers such as disturbance regimes, and environmental variations. The model is built on past conceptual and technical developments (Albert et al., 2008; Midgley et al., 2010) but has been entirely recoded in C++ and revisited."* ([Boulangeat, 2014](http://www.will.chez-alice.fr/pdf/BoulangeatGCB2014.pdf "Boulangeat, I., Georges, D., Thuiller, W., FATE-HD: A spatially and temporally explicit integrated model for predicting vegetation structure and diversity at regional scale. Global Change Biology, 20, 2368â€“2378."))

The website presents more accurately the **model**, as well as the **publications** which introduced it or used it.

**Tutorials** are available for each step of use, going from the installation of the software to its use in different situations.

## [`RFate` package](https://mayagueguen.github.io/RFate/) <img src="pictures/link.png" alt="Link to" style="width:20px;height:20px;">

`RFate` is a `R` package designed to help the user in using the software `FATE-HD`. It provides functions PRE and POST simulations :

- PRE simulations : 
    - to build Plant Functional Groups with dominant species
    - to prepare parameter files
- POST simulations :
    - to produce graphics
    - to analyze results
    - etc
