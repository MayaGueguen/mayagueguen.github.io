### Community Weighted Mean (CWM)

<div style="text-align:center">CWM (for one community site) = <img src="pictures_tutorials/formula_weighted-mean-2.png" width=100px/></div>  

with :

- `xi` = trait value of species i
- `wi` = abundance of species i
- `n` = total number of species

<br/>


**Community Weighted Mean correlation :** correlation between CWM values and environmental values (non-weighted by species' abundances) for all community sites

<br/>

### Species Niche Centroid (SNC)

<div style="text-align:center">SNC (for one species) = <img src="pictures_tutorials/formula_weighted-mean-2.png" width=100px/></div>  

with :

- `xi` = environmental value of site i
- `wi` = abundance of species in site i
- `n` = total number of community sites

<br/>

**Species Niche Centroid correlation :** correlation between SNC values and trait values (non-weighted by species' abundances) for all species

<br/>

### Fourth-corner correlation

- correlation (weighted standardized trait, weighted standardized environment)
- weighted covariance (CWM, weighted standardized environment)
- weighted covariance (weighted standardized trait, SNC)
- weighted regression slope (CWM of weighted standardized trait, weighted standardized environment)  
  *considering the correlations among environmental variables, on the contrary to RLQ*

<br/>

| CWM, SNC correlations | 4th-corner correlation |
|-----------------------|------------------------|
| divide by mean variation | divide by total trait variation |

<br/>

**Maximum (4th-corner correlation) :**

- reached if species distributions are perfectly ordered across columns (species) and rows (sites)
- squared root of 1st eigen value of correspondance analysis of species distribution matrix (sites x species)

<br/>

**Chessel fourth-corner correlation :** 4th-corner correlation / max(4th-corner correlation)

<br/>

### Decomposition of trait variation

CWM / SNC are based on weighted averages : ignore trait variation among species within communities  
(i.e. *within-community component*)

Usually, **CWM** is used to assess **among-community component**, and *average trait distance* (e.g. MPD) to asses *within-community component*. **But they are not additive : they do not sum up to total variation.**

New solution for **within-community component** :

<div style="text-align:center">(for one community site) = alpha i * <img src="pictures_tutorials/formula_within-community.png" width=190px/></div>  

with :

- `alpha i` = abundance weight of site i

- `lij` = abundance of species j in site i
- `SUM lij` = abundance of species in site i
- `tj` = trait value of species j
- `ci` = CWM value of site i
